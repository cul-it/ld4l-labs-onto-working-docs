# LD4All Ontology Recommendation Working Documents

These are working documents for the sake of supporting LD4L Labs needs while the LD4All Ontology Working Groups are still discussing recommendations.

**:star: Nothing in this repository should be taken as a finalized, approved recommendation from the LD4All Ontology review and working group. These are just _working documents_ :star:**

## LD4All Target Ontology Discussions

Being written.

## Possible Recommendation Principles and Patterns

Below are the various recommendation documents being written, reviewed, and discussed as part of the LD4All Ontology Working Groups. They will probably be shared publicly upon approval. These lists are given for the sake of knowing better areas of ontology fragment or modeling pattern work.

### Discussed RDF Principles

- Generic Predicates
- Legacy Literals
- Object versus Data Properties
- Ontology Reuse
- RDFS versus OWL
- Work, Instance, Item (including Property Inheritance)

### Discussed Modeling Patterns (Ontology Fragments)

- Accompaniment
- Activities (including Bibliographic Dates. Replaces Contribution, ProvisionActivity in BIBFRAME)
- Administrative Metadata
- Arrangement & Archival Description
- Attributions
- Awards and Degrees
- Carrier, Content, Media
- Classification
- Derivative Works and Instances
- Dimensions
- Form / Genre
- Holdings, Access and Generic Politics
- Identifiers
- Locations
- Notes and Annotations
- Serials and Other Complex Works
- Titles

### Patterns Probably to be Retained from BIBFRAME 2

Being written.

## Current or Future Collaboration Areas

### LD4All Extensions (In Progress)

- Art Objects Ontology Extension
- Audiovisual Ontology Extension
- Cartographic Resources Ontology Extension
- Moving Image Ontology Extension
- Performed Music Ontology Extension
- Rare Materials Ontology Extension

## Proposed Working Groups

- Archival Description
- RDA Alignment
- Serials Working Group

## LD4All Ontology Recommendation Deliverables

- LD4All Target Ontology RDF Document
- LD4All Target Ontology Application Profile
 - human readable form (spreadsheet)
 - machine-actionable form (via ActiveTriples)
- MARC21 to BIBFRAME version 2 and to LD4All Target Ontology Mapping
 - spreadsheet with mappings, normalization recommendations
 - machine-actionable form?
- Recommendation Documents (modeled possible off those mentioned above)
- Sample RDF using the possible LD4All Target Ontology and side-by-side MARC21 comparison records
 - Part of this effort will include generate MARC21 input to LD4All RDF output fragments for the RSpec convertor testing
