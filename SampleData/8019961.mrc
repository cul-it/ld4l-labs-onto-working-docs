Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library.  aFounded in 1909 by James H. Anderson, the New York Amsterdam News is one of the oldest African-American owned and run newspapers in the country. Initially focused on local news in New York in general and Harlem in particular, the Amsterdam News broadened its scope to include national news under the guidance of editor Dr. C.B. Powell in the 1930s. By the 1960s, the newspaper had become a major voice in the national African-American community, offering extensive coverage of the civil rights movement. Beginning in 1982, the newspaper was edited by Wilbert A. Tatum, under whose guidance the newspaper remained a voice in local and national affairs. In 1996, Tatum turned control of the newspaper over to his daughter, Elinor Tatum, who remained the publisher and editor-in-chief through the 2000s.  aIn English.  aA series listing is available.00aNew York Amsterdam news. 0aAfrican American newspapers. 0aAfrican AmericanszNew York (State)zNew York. 0aNew York (N.Y.)vPictorial works. 0aHarlem (New York, N.Y.)vPictorial works. 7aPhotographs.2aat 7aAfrican American newspapers2fast0(OCoLC)fst00799278 7aAfrican Americans2fast0(OCoLC)fst00799558 7aNew York (State)zNew York2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204333 7aNew York (State)zNew YorkzHarlem2fast0(OCoLC)fst01312318 7aPictorial works2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423874423Finding aiduhttp://resolver.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/EADresolver?id=RMM080840 a20130410bidedm29ermch?1 a20130410bodedm29ermc2 a20130522bmdedm29ermc2 a20130522bmdmnr1elts2 a20150102bmdbatcheltsxaddfast
