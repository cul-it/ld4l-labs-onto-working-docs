# LD4All Target Ontology Discussions Deliverables

## These are a work in progress based on yet to be confirmed LD4All decisions.

## Projected / In Progress Deliverables

1. Series of recommendation / explanatory reports on the LD4All Target Ontology (especially where this diverges from BIBFRAME 2) written by the LD4All Ontology Alignment Group and proposed to the LD4All Ontology Group for comment, discussion, and acceptance.
2. MARC21 to LD4All Target Ontology (and, depending on the Library of Congress specification, BIBFRAME version 2) Mapping (stored in a CSV file)
3. A LD4All Target Ontology Metadata Application Profile.
  4. This would include a human-readable form (a CSV file), as well as
  5. [Proposed] a form of the MAP in ActiveTriples and/or as RSpec test fragments.
4. Sample MARC21 bibliographic records which we manually convert to the LD4All Target Ontology ideal.
  5. These are to be used as conversion exemplars.
